CHECK-3#1 Warning
Report rule limit reached  
REQP-1839 rule limit reached: 20 violations have been found.
Related violations: <none>

IOSR-1#1 Warning
IOB set reset sharing  
IO RsRx connects to flops which have these resetGen/CPUreset, resetGen/resetHW set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
