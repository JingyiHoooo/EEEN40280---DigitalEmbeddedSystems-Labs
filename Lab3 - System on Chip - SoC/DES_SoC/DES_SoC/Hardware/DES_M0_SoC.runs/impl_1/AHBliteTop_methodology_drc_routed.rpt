TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_out0_clk_wiz_1 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 2 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clockGen/plle2_adv_inst_high/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#2 Warning
